# What is Decent Sampler?

# How is a Decent Sampler Sample?

The plugin can read **.dspreset** and **.dslibrary** files

A **.dslibrary** file is a *zip file* that contains the **.dspreset** file and the *.wav* files that needs as a package file

A **.dspreset** file is a *text file* in *XML format* with the sample details on it

You can find the **.dspreset** file format here: [**File Format Reference Guide**](https://www.decentsamples.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/format-documentation.html)
