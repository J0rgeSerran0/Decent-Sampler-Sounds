# Decent Sampler Sounds

I would like to share with you the libraries/sounds I have done for the **Decent Sampler Plugin** in my spare time

Hours and days investigating how to convert the sounds into a *Decent Sampler* file that I hope that helps

# What is Decent Sampler?

If you don't know *what is Decent Sampler*, I have to say about it that is a free sampling plugin that allows you to play samples in the Decent Sampler format
